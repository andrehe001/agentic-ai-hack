# Unlocking Multi-Agent Capabilities with Azure AI Services

Welcome to the Multi-Agent Insurance Claims Processing using Azure AI Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the revolutionary world of intelligent agent systems, with a focus on harnessing the transformative power of Azure AI services for complex insurance workflows. Prepare yourself for an intensive day of learning, innovation, and hands-on experience that will elevate your understanding of multi-agent AI systems and their real-world applications in insurance claim processing.

## Introduction

Get ready to transform the insurance industry! In this hackathon, you'll embark on an exciting journey from processing documents to orchestrating intelligent AI agents that revolutionize how insurance claims are handled. You're not just building code—you're architecting the future of automated insurance workflows.

Your adventure begins with teaching machines to "see" and understand complex insurance documents, from handwritten claim forms to damage photos. Then you'll breathe life into your first AI agent, watching it learn to think, reason, and make decisions like an experienced insurance professional. But here's where it gets really exciting: you'll create an entire ecosystem of specialized AI agents—each with unique superpowers.

Picture this: A Policy Checker agent that instantly validates coverage with laser precision, a Claim Reviewer that analyzes submissions with detective-like attention to detail, and a Risk Analyzer that spots fraud patterns human eyes might miss. The magic happens when these agents start collaborating, seamlessly passing work between each other, negotiating decisions, and solving complex claims that would typically take weeks to resolve.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have built a complete multi-agent orchestra conducting the symphony of modern insurance claim processing—and you'll never look at AI the same way again!


## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- **Build Intelligent Document Processing Systems**: Master the integration of Azure Document Intelligence and Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to extract, analyze, and structure information from complex insurance documents including policies, claims, and visual damage assessments through advanced OCR and multimodal AI capabilities.

- **Create and Test AI Agents**: Build your first intelligent agent using Azure AI Agent Service to handle insurance claim processing workflows, learning the fundamentals of agent development and testing.

- **Implement Agent Observability and Evaluation**: Develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks using Azure AI Foundry's capabilities to systematically assess agent performance, implement continuous monitoring, and ensure quality, safety, and reliability standards.

- **Build Specialized Multi-Agent Systems**: Create multiple specialized AI agents (Policy Checker, Claim Reviewer, Risk Analyser) using Semantic Kernel integration, each with enhanced capabilities for specific insurance processing tasks.

- **Master Agent Orchestration Patterns**: Design and coordinate multiple specialized agents to work together through various orchestration patterns including sequential, concurrent, group chat, handoff, and managerial orchestration for complex insurance claim workflows.
