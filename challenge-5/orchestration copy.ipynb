    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",

    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",

    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Risk Analysis:\n",
      "1. Claim Details: The claim involves a vehicle owned by John Peterson, a 2004 Honda Accord, with significant front-left side damage reported after an incident in a parking lot on July 17, 2025, at 8:30 AM. The incident was witnessed and reported to the police, with a formal police report and repair shop estimate attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Claim Consistency: The damage description aligns with the reported incident‚Äîimpact to the front bumper, driver‚Äôs side quarter panel, and related mechanical parts. Photos corroborate this damage with visible severe crumpling, detachment of bumper parts, and use of a spare tire suggesting some prior mechanical issues or emergency response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Additional Crashes: The claimant has another crash reported two days later (July 19, 2025) involving a different vehicle, which while separate, may indicate a pattern of frequent claims in a short period.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Fraud Indicators:\n",
      "   - Timing: Two claims within three days could be unusual and warrant verification of both incidents‚Äô legitimacy.\n",
      "   - Damage Consistency: Both the report and photographic evidence are consistent, reducing suspicion around fabricated damage.\n",
      "   - Witness and Police Report: Presence of third-party witness and police report adds credibility.\n",
      "   - Spare Tire Observation: The use of a spare tire on the damaged vehicle could indicate prior unresolved vehicle condition issues or recent activity relevant to claim context.\n",
      "   - Multiple Recent Claims: The additional claim by the same claimant in a short period potentially increases risk for fraudulent or exaggerated claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Geographic and Temporal Clustering: Both claims occurred within the Springfield, OH area in close temporal proximity, which calls for attention but is not inherently indicative of fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Score: 6/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for Investigation:\n",
      "- Verify details and legitimacy of the secondary claim in Dayton to ensure no overlap or fraud attempts.\n",
      "- Confirm the other driver‚Äôs information and cross-verify with police records to exclude staged accidents.\n",
      "- Have a detailed mechanical inspection of the vehicle to assess hidden damages and check if the spare tire scenario has any impact on claim legitimacy.\n",
      "- Review claimant's historical claim patterns further for potential risk clustering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the claim appears credible but the presence of multiple claims in a short timeframe raises moderate concern and warrants additional investigation before approval of full coverage.\n",

      "\n",
      "Detailed Analysis:\n",
      "1. Claim Documentation and Completeness:\n",
      "   - The claim contains comprehensive documentation including a detailed incident description, damage description, witness contact information, police report with a report number, and repair shop details.\n",
      "   - Attached evidence includes vehicle damage photos, a police report PDF, and a repair estimate from a reputable auto body shop.\n",

      "2. Incident and Damage Assessment:\n",
      "   - The incident occurred on July 17, 2025, at 8:30 AM in a parking lot, consistent with the claimant's description of circumstances where the vehicle was legally parked and struck by another vehicle.\n",
      "   - Reported damage includes front bumper dislodgement, severe denting and scraping on the driver's side front quarter panel, damage to the wheel and tire, paint transfer on the driver's door, damage to headlamp and grille, and possible hidden mechanical damage.\n",
      "   - The photos and damage assessment corroborate the described damage, showing moderate to severe front-left impact, including structural and mechanical concerns.\n",
      "   - The involvement of witnesses and police along with full police report documentation supports claim credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Repair Costs and Estimates:\n",
      "   - The presence of a repair estimate from Springfield Auto Body suggests that repair costs have been professionally evaluated.\n",
      "   - The claimant requests full coverage of repair costs minus deductible, which aligns with standard insurance procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Additional Considerations:\n",
      "   - The claimant has a second unrelated crash reported but clearly separated with full documentation and a different vehicle, indicating transparency and no attempts to combine claims improperly.\n",
      "   - The vehicle‚Äôs condition and damage severity align logically with the described incident scenario and witness statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missing Documentation or Concerns:\n",
      "- The actual repair estimate document was mentioned but not directly reviewed here; a final review of detailed cost estimates is recommended to confirm reasonableness.\n",
      "- Confirmation that coverage terms are met should be done by the policy checker (e.g., coverage for third-party collision, deductible amounts).\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "- Verify the repair estimate amounts to ensure they are fair and consistent with typical repair costs for the described damage.\n",
      "- Confirm coverage terms with the policy for collision damage in parking lots and whether deductible applies as expected.\n",
      "- Proceed with standard inspection and approval of repairs through the specified repair shop.\n",
