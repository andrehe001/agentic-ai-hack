# Challenge 5: Agent Orchestration

## Introduction
By this point we have created **the three agent** and have seen how to evaluate and observe that specific agent. As you know, our use case is a bit more complex and, therefore, we will now create the rest of our architecture to actually make it a multi-agent architecture. The key word for this challenge will be **Orchestration**.

## What's orchestration and what types are there?
Orchestration in AI agent systems is the process of coordinating multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks that a single agent cannot handle alone. It helps break down problems, delegate work efficiently, and ensure that each part of a workflow is managed by the agent best suited for it. 

Some common Orchestration Patterns are:

| Pattern                  | Simple Description                                                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Orchestration | Agents handle tasks one after the other in a fixed order, passing results along.   |
| Concurrent Orchestration | Many agents work at the same time on similar or different parts of a task.         |
| Group Chat Orchestration | Agents (and people, if needed) discuss and collaborate in a shared conversation.   |
| Handoff Orchestration    | Each agent works until it can’t continue, then hands off the task to another agent.|
| Magentic Orchestration   | A manager agent plans and assigns tasks on the fly as new needs and solutions arise.|

Now you might be wondering... ok great... but, **how do I decide on an Orchestration Pattern?** The answer to that question is mostly related to your use case. Let's simplify the 2 most common Orchestration patterns:

| Pattern                    | Flow                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Sequential Orchestration   | Agent A → Agent B → Agent C            |
| Concurrent Orchestration   | Agent A + Agent B + Agent C → Combine Results |

In `Sequential Orchestration` the Agents are dependent on the task from the previous agent. This is very common in workflows like document processing or step-by-step procedures. With `Concurrent Orchestration` the agents are not dependent on each other and therefore it makes this a great orchestration for parallel processing, multi-source research and so on.

## Let's come back to our use case...
`Concurrent Orchestration` is the answer for our use case. We will have 3 agents that are each responsible for gathering specialized information on different matters from different datasources in our knowledge base. In the end, we will create a 4th agent that is responsible for Orchestrating these 3 agents and create the final output that we need. Our orchestration will be something like the following:
