Additionally, international travel coverage (Canada and Mexico with certain conditions) and out-of-state coverage enhancements are offered. Policyholders can also benefit from emergency transportation home coverage and extended trip protection. Discounts available include multi-vehicle, safe driver, anti-theft device, defensive driving course, good student, and low mileage discounts. Coverage terms may include standard 6 or 12-month policy periods with automatic renewal, and options for new vehicle replacement within 2 years under comprehensive and collision coverage. Specific coverage limits, deductibles, and exclusions would be outlined within the policy details. For exact coverage limits, deductibles, and conditions, review the motorcycle policy sections on coverage and terms, including Sections 9 and 10 for policy terms and special provisions. If you need coverage for Mexico beyond temporary visits, additional coverage is required.【3:0†motorcycle_policy.md】【3:2†comprehensive_auto_policy.md】</div>\n",
